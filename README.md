# Fake_News_Detection

News Classification Model Using NLP
Built a machine learning model to classify news as reliable or unreliable using NLP techniques.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared text data, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming to improve domain-specific vocabulary.

Feature Engineering: Applied TF-IDF vectorization to transform text data into numerical format for model training.

Model Training: Utilized a Decision Tree Classifier to classify news articles, splitting the data into training and testing sets for validation.

Model Deployment: Saved both the trained model and TF-IDF vectorizer using pickle for future use.

Prediction Function: Developed a function to predict news reliability, outputting results as "real", "fake", or "unpredictable".

Streamlit App: Built a user-friendly Streamlit app for real-time news classification and interaction.
